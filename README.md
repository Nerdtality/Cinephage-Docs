## About

This is the documentation site for [Cinephage](https://github.com/MoldyTaint/Cinephage) — a unified, self-hosted media management platform that replaces the traditional *arr stack (Radarr, Sonarr, Prowlarr, Bazarr, Overseerr, and FlareSolverr) with a single Docker container and a single database.

The site is built with [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/) and deployed automatically to [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).

## What's Inside

The documentation follows the [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Getting Started** | Step-by-step tutorials to get Cinephage installed and running |
| **Guides** | Task-oriented how-tos for configuration, daily use, and deployment |
| **Reference** | Technical reference for environment variables, database schema, YAML specs, and API |
| **Explanation** | Architecture deep-dives, design decisions, and concept breakdowns |

## How It Works

This site is fully automated — no manual builds or deployments needed:

- **Auto-deploy** — Cloudflare Workers deploys the site on every push to `main`
- **Build checks** — GitHub Actions validates the build on all pushes and pull requests
- **Source sync** — Git submodules tracking the Cinephage source code auto-update every 6 hours via GitHub Actions, keeping the docs in sync with the latest codebase

## Contributing

The easiest way to contribute is to click the **"Edit this page"** link at the bottom of any page on the [live site](https://docs.cinephage.net) — this opens the file directly in GitHub for editing.

For larger changes, fork the repository, create a branch, and submit a pull request. All PRs are automatically built and verified before merging.
